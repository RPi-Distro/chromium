description: work around FTBFS on clang-13 under armhf & i386

We see the following on 32bit platforms on older clang:

ld.lld-13: error: undefined symbol: __mulodi4
>>> referenced by const_eval.cc


This symbol is in libclang_rt's builtins, but for whatever reason it doesn't
get included. Not worth sending upstream since this doesn't happen in
bookworm, only in bullseye.
