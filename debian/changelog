  * debian/rules, debian/chromium-codecs-ffmpeg{,-extra}.install: ffmpeg is a
    first-class component library now, not a special snowflake. Still, build
    it differently, but build flags are different. 
  * debian/tests/smoketest-actual: Remove some innocuous mentions of "error"
    before testing for actual errors.
  * debian/control: codec library packages replace the libffmpeg.so that 
    was in chromium packages before now.
  * debian/control: codec packages can't reasonably be updated separately 
    than chromium. Depend with version specification also.

chromium-browser (28.0.1500.71-0ubuntu0.13.10.1) saucy; urgency=low

  * New release 28.0.1500.71.
  * debian/chromium-browser.install: Include inspector resources in
    chromium-browser package.
  * debian/control: Make new -dbg package for chromedriver.
  * debian/rules:
    - Remove tests for ancient versions of Ubuntu.
    - Return to using no explicity NEON fpu, and instead try to detect at
      runtime NEON caps. This effectively disables NEON, so far.
    - Build and run unit test suite as part of making a package. Abort if
      more than 15 out of ~1000 tests fail.
    - Clean up packaging sanity test that verifies everything we build is
      put into a package.
    - Set relative rpath to libs/ for chromium-browser executable, but . for
      libraries in libs/ ; that makes dpkg-shlibdeps happy and process run.
    - Strip out some ugly logic around keeping only one language in the main
      package, and keeping the contents verifier happy based on the
      architecture.
    - EXPERIMENT: Try not stripping enormous libraries' symbols explicitly.
    - Add more exceptions for packaging contents tests, this time to exclude
      files that are in package but not from the build tree.
    - Be more explicit about what files we set the rpath on.  Get all
      executables. We missed chromedriver before.
    - Only one hardware arch builds the independent files, so in our sanity
      test that we install everything upstream built once and only once in
      packages, we have to consider whether this build didn't even try to
      take and use arch-independent files.  Don't look for some file paths if
      we don't use them.  (Also, if we match too much of what we used, also
      remove matches from the list of created.  This should be better.)
  * debian/patches/arm-neon.patch:
    - Compile in NEON instructions for ARM, even if we can't reliably check for
      whether our CPU is capable of running them yet.  The major problem
      remaining is that the sandbox security wrapper defeats any test of
      /proc/cpuinfo .
  * debian/source/lintian-overrides:
    - Supress warnings about known intentional decisions: Package name, 
      statically linked bundled libraries, setuid root sandbox.
  * debian/chromium-browser.sh.in:
    - Detect at startup the features of the CPU that we might be intersted
      in and export info into the environment.  This is step one of a longer
      workaround for sandbox /proc restrictions.
  * Make a fall-back for when upstream fails to release a Release. Package up
    as best we can from source control.  debian/rules and 
    debian/checkout-orig-source.mk .
  * debian/tests/:
    - Add smoketest to verify that chromium runs.
    - Add a empty webapps test file for notes about what parts of webapps will
      or should be tested.
  * debian/keep-alive.sh.  Quit if disk environment disappears.

  * New stable release 28.0.1500.45

    - CVE-2013-2848: Possible data extraction with XSS Auditor.
    - CVE-2013-2849: Possible XSS with drag+drop or copy+paste.
  * Drop unneeded patches,
      safe-browsing-sigbus.patch
      dont-assume-cross-compile-on-arm.patch
      struct-siginfo.patch
      ld-memory-32bit.patch
      dlopen_sonamed_gl.patch
  * Temporarily disable webapps patches.
  * Update arm-neon patch, format-flag patch, search-credit patch,
    title-bar-system-default patch.
  * Make get-orig-source nicer.  Package tarball contents from upstream
    correctly.
  * Reenable dyn-linking of major components of chromium for 32-bit machines.
    Fix a libdir path bug in debian/chromium-browser.sh.in .
  * No longer try to use system libraries. Generally, Security Team would
    hate bundled libraries because they provide a wide liability, but 
    Chromium Project is pretty good about maintaining their bundled-source
    libraries. We can not pull cr-required lib versions forward in older
    Ubuntus, and we can't guarantee all the distro versions of libraries work
    with chromium-browser. The default security policy might be worse. Bundled
    libraries is less work overall.
  * Exclude included XDG files even if they are built.
  * Use NEON instructions on ARM, optionally. This might use run-time checks
    for hardware capability, but even if it doesn't we can add it later.
  * Clean up difference checks in debian/rules that make sure that all files
    that the build makes are used in packages, and no longer hide any, and no
    longer consider it an error if some are unused.  Treat it as a warning,
    not a fatality.
  * Use legible shell instead of make-generated shell in setting the rpath
    in rules.
  * Add new build-dep, "chrpath".

  [Chris Coulson]
  * debian/rules: Disable tcmalloc on all component builds, not just on
    arm builds.

      - sqlite causes link failures.
    Updating debian/rules, and dropping the removed ones from debian/control .
  * debian/rules:
    - Use actual original upstream tarball.  No SVN snapshots, no gclient.
    - Rip out compiler-targeting.  All versions should work.

    32 bit machines more likely to use BDF linker and include parameters
    that make it more memory efficient.
  * GCC doesn't allow -Wno-format with hardening -Werror=format-security .
    Add debian/patches/format-flag.patch .
  * Since we're Depending on xdg-settings, don't try to install one from 
    upstream.  Change debian/chromium-browser.install .
  * Invert sense of a quantal+ test so that we don't have to track things
    forever.  Name things we know about, instead of things that don't exist
    yet.  Update debian/rules .
  * Drop old unused sizes of icons to install from debian/rules .
  * Always default chromium to using the system title bar.  Add 
    debian/patches/title-bar-default-system.patch .
  * Default third-party cookies to most secure to users: off.  Add
    debian/patches/third-party-cookies-off-by-default.patch .
  * Remove flags that make several useful application actions only appear
    on Unity.  Update debian/chromium-browser.desktop .
  * Add a lp:app-install-data-ubuntu flag that names the package.  Update 
    debian/chromium-browser.desktop .
  * Remove full path from freedesktop default-apps file.  Update
    debian/chromium-browser.xml .

  * Add comment-markers to debian/patches/series file to make patch import
    easier.
  * debian/patches/gyp-config-root.patch
    - Added. Avoids compilation bug on (at least) ARM.
  * debian/patches/arm-neon.patch
    - Added function to determine NEON functionality in ARM at runtime for
      WebRt library in WebKit.
  * Update README.source to include some of these changes.
  * Set new URL for channel-release info in rules file.
  * debian/chromium-browser.install
    - No longer install demo extension
    - Install remoting locales
  * debian/patches/chromium_useragent.patch.in renamed to drop ".in",
    OS "Ubuntu" hardcoded with no compilation-release name, and patch
    refreshed to follow new location of source.  Also remove it
    from the list of ephemeral files that "clean" rule removes.
  * In debian/rules, use "-delete" flag on find instead of "-exec rm {} \;",
    to be safer and faster.
  * Make most patches follow a common format (no timestamps or Index lines), to
    avoid future churn.
  * Write the "REMOVED" list files to the root of the orig tarball,
    instead of inside the src/ directory, where they could collide.
  * Fix dpkg-source warning: Clean up python cached bytecode files.
  * Also don't include python bytecode or cache files in orig tarball,
    and clean then up on "clean" rule.
  * Fix dpkg-source warning: Remove autoconf cache.
  * Fix lintian warning: fta and micahg to XSBC-Original-Maintainer.
  * Fix lintian error not-binnmuable-all-depends-any.
  * Override lintian complaints ancient-autotools-helper-file and

  * Set default binary and source package compression to xz. If 
    building for Ubuntu 10.04, then make binary's compression to bzip2.
  * List explicit architectures that Chromium supports, instead of "any".
    Cr {arm ia32 x64} map into Debian {armhf armel i386 amd64}.
  * debian/patches/arm-neon.patch added to get ARM w/o Neon support.
    (LP: #1084852)
  * Add chromedriver packaging. (LP: #1069930) Thanks to

    grd_parse_fix.patch .
  * Set default binary and source package compression to xz. If 
    building for Ubuntu 10.04, then make binary's compression to bzip2.
  * No longer expect unpacked tarball to contain "build-tree".
  * Fix build warning about missing debian/source/format.  Set to "3.0
    (quilt)".
  * Remove unnecessary glib-header-single-entry.patch .
  * Manually set DEB_{BUILD,HOST}_ARCH when not already set, like when the
    executing program is not dpkg-buildpackage.
  * Make rules file generate LASTCHANGE file at new location.
  * Change get-sources command to kill script when it fails to disable

chromium-browser (5.0.342.7~r42476-0ubuntu1) lucid; urgency=low

  * New upstream release from the Beta Channel
    - fix an issue with Google SSL sites failing with 'error 107
      (net::ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR)' (issue 37722)
    - Automatic translations and greater control over content for privacy
    - Really, really reload. A normal reload causes the browser to check with
      the server before reusing its cached content.  The server can decide
      whether or not the browser should use its cached content.  A force reload
      causes the browser to ignore its cached content and ask the server for a
      fresh copy of the page. Use Shift+Reload to force a reload.
