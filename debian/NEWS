chromium-browser (104.0.5112.79-2) unstable; urgency=low

  We've switched the default search engine from Google to DuckDuckGo.
  To manually override it, just go into Settings, click "Search Engine",
  and next to "Search engine used in the address bar", select a different
  search engine from the pull-down.

  Also, catching up on a few upstream changes:

  TLSv1 and TLSv1.1 support have been completely dropped from chromium
  (as described in https://chromestatus.com/feature/5759116003770368).
  Support for CPUs that lack SSE3 extensions has also been dropped (as
  described on
  https://www.tomshardware.com/news/chrome-stops-working-on-old-processors).
  Most users shouldn't notice, unless you're using older hardware or
  "securely" communicating with older hardware.

  Lastly, Chromium 101 changed a setting for host-based authentication.
  This broke some folks' Kerberos, among other things. "AuthServerWhitelist"
  was renamed to "AuthServerAllowlist", as described in
  https://bugs.debian.org/1013268

chromium-browser (69.0.3497.100-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  All local extensions that are installed to /usr/share/chromium/extensions
  will now be loaded and enabled automatically.

  Some extension packages used to do this manually with a file in
  /etc/chromium.d. This conflicts with the new approach, so those packages
  need to be updated to account for this.

  External extensions were enabled by default in an upload prior to the
  release of stretch and will remain this way for the buster release.  A
  future upload following the release of buster will disable this.

chromium-browser (55.0.2883.75-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  External extensions are now disabled by default.  Chromium will only load
  extensions that are explicitly specified with the --load-extension command
  line option passed into CHROMIUM_FLAGS.  See the chromium-lwn4chrome
  package for an example of how to do this.

  You can also use the --enable-remote-extensions command line argument to
  chromium, which will bypass this restriction.
