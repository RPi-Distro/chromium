    - CVE-2022-3056: Insufficient policy enforcement in Content

    - CVE-2022-3057: Inappropriate implementation in iframe Sandbox.
      Reported by Gareth Heyes.

      Reported by raven at KunLun lab.
  * Drop workaround for lack of older clang's -ffile-prefix-map. This
    should make reproducible builds happy.
  * debian/copyright:
    - Update for new libevent location (moved out of base/).
    - libopenjpeg20 -> libopenjpeg
  * debian/patches:
    - debianization/support-i386.patch: refresh.
    - disable/catapult.patch: refresh.
    - disable/libaom-arm.patch: refresh.
    - system/event.patch: update for new libevent location.
    - system/openjpeg.patch: refresh.
    - bullseye/clang13.patch: drop part of patch dropped upstream.
    - upstream/disk-cache.patch: build fix pulled from upstream.
    - upstream/browser-finder.patch: build fix pulled from upstream.
    - upstream/masklayer-geom.patch: build fix pulled from upstream.
    - system/jsoncpp.patch: drop, merged upstream.
    - fixes/angle-wayland: build fix due to mismatched wayland headers
      on sid. Only needed until angle updates its copy of wayland.
    - disable/welcome-page.patch: drop. Upstream fixed the original
      issue some time ago, and this new version finally cleaned up
      the workaround.
    - fixes/connection-message.patch: drop it. I looked at sending this
      upstream, but the original extension doesn't exist any more,
      and chromium properly prints an error if a proxy is unreachable.
      If you can still reproduce the issue (described in
      http://bugs.debian.org/864539), let me know so I can get it fixed
      upstream.
  * debian/scripts/unbundle: upstream tripled the number of (previously
    vendored) libraries that we can use system versions of. However,
    the majority of them are either not in bullseye or are too old, so
    we'll have to wait to use the debian versions for the ones not newly
    added as build-deps.
  * Disable optimize_webui, due to a build failure using nodejs from
    bullseye. I'll reenable this when it either gets fixed or we're done
    with bullseye security support.
  * Remove sse3-support dependency and just refuse to run if SSE3 is
    not present. Breaking via preinst script isn't appropriate for
    packages that might be installed by default (eg, by Debian Edu).
  * debian/control: add build-deps for brotli, libdouble-conversion-dev,
    libwoff-dev, and libxnvctrl-dev (closes: #987292).
  * Rework default search engine stuff. People did not like the "Your
    browser is managed" and "Your administrator can change your browser
    setup remotely" messages, which are admittedly alarming.
    Instead of using /etc/chromium/policies/recommended/duckduckgo.json,
    delete that and use /etc/chromium/master_preferences instead.

  * debian/copyright:
    - Stop dropping third_party/zlib/contrib/, which is just source code
      with acceptable licenses.
    - Replace the rule that dropped third_party/depot_tools with a more
      specific rule that drops just the ninja binaries. Also delete some
      unused png files to work around a bug in our scripts.
    - Replace a rule that dropped third_party/devtools-frontend/src/test
      with just dropping all wasm files ('*.wasm'), as well as
      third_party/devtools-frontend/src/test/screenshots/image_diff/.
  * debian/patches:
    - upstream/rvo-workaround.patch - added to fix FTBFS w/ clang-11. Pulled
      from upstream git.
    - disable/swiftshader-2.patch - drop most of it that's wrapped in a
      check for windows.
    - disable/fuzzers.patch - drop it; with the last release modifying
      fuzzer inclusion, we can now configure the build without this.
    - disable/owners.patch - drop it; no longer needed with depot_tools
      remaining in the source tree.
    - disable/devtools-unittests.patch - drop it; no longer needed if
      we keep third_party/devtools-frontend/src/test in the source tree.
    - disable/tests.patch - drop half of it; the media/gpu changes aren't
      needed, while keeping stuff in third_party/devtools-frontend/src/test
      from building is still necessary.
  * Drop enable_nacl_nonsfi=false from debian/rules, as upstream got rid
    of the variable.
  * New upstream security release.

  * Fix debian/watch to find the correct upstream version.
  * Ensure xz uses all available cpu cores when preparing orig.tar.gz
  * Switch to bundled ICU, since Debian's ICU is 2 years old at this point
    and upstream depends on a bunch of new API in ICU 69.1.
  * debian/copyright:
    - ensure all *.dlls are dropped from source.
    - Stop dropping '*fuzz' directories. It was too aggressive, resulting
      in build errors for perfectly fine BSD-3-clause and similar code.
    - Instead, drop '*corpus' and '*corpora' directories. Some of it is
      fine (lots generated by oss-fuzz with .dict files provided), but
      not all of it is and it's easier to just drop it.
    - Drop an esbuild binary.
    - The full upstream tarball includes additional stuff we don't want,
      so drop *.jar, tools/win, and some other stuff in third_party/.
  * debian/rules:
    - Disabling & deleting swiftshader now also needs to add
      dawn_use_swiftshader=false.
    - Switch from -lite upstream tarball to the full tarball in order to
      include ICU sources.
  * debian/patches:
    - upstream/libdrm.patch - drop, merged upstream.
    - debianization/manpage.patch - drop a small chunk merged upstream.
    - system/icu.patch - drop now that we're bundling ICU.
    - bullseye/icu-types.patch - drop now that we're bundling ICU.
    - system/convertutf.patch - update build for bundled ICU path.
    - fixes/closure.patch - drop now that we're no longer using lite tarball.
    - disable/driver-chrome-path.patch - refresh for BUILDFLAG() macro.
    - system/jsoncpp.patch - refresh for unrelated ios change.
    - disable/catapult.patch - refresh due to moving around of .pak files.
