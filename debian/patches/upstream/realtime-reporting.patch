    libstdc++: real time reporting bindings vector requires full declaration
    
    libstdc++ implementation of std::vector requires the full declaration
    of the type and not a forward declaration. This breaks compilation of
    RealTimeReportingBindings, as it has an std::vector of
    RealTimeReportingContributionPtr.
