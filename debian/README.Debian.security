Notes about security support for Chromium in Debian

==============================================

Due to the high frequency of security releases and large amount
of effort required, Debian's Chromium packages will only receive
6 months of security support in the oldstable distribution
(instead of the typical 12 months).

The 6 months of oldstable security support begins when a
distribution, beginning with Debian 11 'bullseye', transitions
from stable to oldstable.
